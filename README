This is the ID3 Tag Editor. Often there are URL embeded 
into the ID3 frames (Title, Artist, Album). They are often
annoying when used on mobile phones, since they sort 
based on these tags. This program aims to remove unwanted 
text from the MP3 file making it clean and simple.

Compile using gcc -o id3BatchEditor <id3BatchEditor.c>

Inorder to run the program use the following syntax.

id3BatchEditor -f <list of mp3 files or *mp3> -r <text to be
removed>

Feel free for any suggestion or improvements.
